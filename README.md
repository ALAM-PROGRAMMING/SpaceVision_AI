# ðŸš€ spacevision_ai â€” Astronauts Extra Set of Eyes

> An object detection system designed to enhance astronaut safety during EVAs by identifying critical mission equipment through cutting-edge AI.

## ðŸ§  What is spacevision_ai?

`spacevision_ai` is an intelligent object detection system powered by **YOLOv8** that helps astronauts identify vital tools, such as fire extinguishers, oxygen tanks, and toolboxes, in real-time. (Future Vision) Integrated as a vision assistant into space helmets, it acts as a **second pair of eyes**, improving spatial awareness and reaction time during spacewalks and repairs.

## ðŸŒŒ Why It Matters

In the vast void of space, visibility, response time, and situational awareness can mean the difference between life and death. This system ensures astronauts:
- Donâ€™t miss critical equipment
- Can work more independently with AI assistance
- Get real-time alerts in harsh, low-visibility environments
